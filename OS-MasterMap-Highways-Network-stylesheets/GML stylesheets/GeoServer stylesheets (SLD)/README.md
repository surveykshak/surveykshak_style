# OS MasterMap Highways Network

These are SLD files for OS MasterMap Highways Network in GZ/GML format for use in GeoServer.

*They have been designed to work with the data loaded into a database, for example PostGIS, with field names in full and in lowercase.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-MasterMap-Highways-Network-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository.

**2.**  Copy the folder ‘ordnance_survey_highways’ into your GeoServer styles directory (a typical Windows file apth is C:\Program Files (x86)\GeoServer 2.x.x\data_dir\styles, if using a workspace then use the \data_dir\styles path from there.

**3.**  Load your OS MasterMap Highways Network line data into GeoServer.

**4.**  Add the styles. If using the GUI then navigate to Styles > Add a new style > Browse and select to add each file in turn.

**5.**  Publish these styles with the data. If using the GUI then navigate to Layers > Add a new resource and choose them from the relevant database to add each file in turn, click on publish, configure settings and then choose the matching style before saving.

Note: Choose RoadLink-1.sld file to style by road classification or select the RoadLink-2.sld file to style by a combination of route hierarchy and form of way.

**6.**  We have given you a style for 'out-of-the-box' vector features from the Road and Path themes, including two options for styling RoadLink. Use the RoadLink-1.sld file to style by road classification or select the RoadLink-2.sld file to style by a combination of route hierarchy and form of way.

**7.**  To create Highways Network in GeoServer you will need to create a Layer Group. If using the GUI then navigate to Layer Groups > Add new layer group > Add Layer and choose each layer in turn to create the following layer order:

  SpecialDesignation_point
	Reinstatement_point
	Maintenance_point
	FerryNode
	FerryNode_Path
	PathNode
	RoadNode
	ConnectingNode
	AccessRestriction
	Structure
	RestrictionForVehicles
	SpecialDesignation_Line
	Reinstatement_line
	Maintenance_line
	HighwayDedication
	Reinstatement_area
	RoadLink
	PathLink
	FerryLink
	FerryLink_Path
	ConnectingLink


The name of this Layer Group is the ‘layer’ your web map service (WMS) will need to call.

The scale denominators have been set to allow viewing between **1:250** and **1:20 000**, although this will vary slightly by resolution.

Your data should now look similar to this:

##Compatibility notes

Although SLD is an open OGC standard, these SLDs do contain some extended code used by GeoServer, namely the ‘vendor option’ tags. Also, as aforementioned, the field names referenced in the SLDs are in full and in lowercase.
