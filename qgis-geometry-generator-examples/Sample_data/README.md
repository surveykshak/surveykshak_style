# Sample data

This folder contains a Geopackage file that contains 3 layers:
* SamplePoints
* SampleLines
* SamplePolygons

The data in these layers is completely random and contains a limited number of fields and are just for testing purposes. All layers are in the Lambert 72 Belgium CRS ([EPSG:31370](https://epsg.io/31370)), that has meters as units.

These layers can be opened in QGIS and are used to test the QML files that are lockated in the other folders.
