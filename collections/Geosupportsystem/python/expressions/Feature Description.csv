US: (Harbaugh): Unclear as to what type of structure this is.  Is this a building?  What's the purpose of this structure?
UK:  Agree with feature addition.  Concern with definition wording.  British definitions include “covered passageway lined with shops” and “set of arches and their supporting columns”.  Suggest FWP discuss to ensure generic enough definition.YES …..but…..
CZ:  Are the words ""... steps or stairs ..."" in the definiton necessary?  We have most Arcades without stairs.
US(Buckley):  How about changing the definition to: ""A relatively permanent covered passageway or lane, roofed, and normally consisting of a series of arches supported by columns, piers or pillars; usually open on the sides and commonly lined with shops on either side, and if multi-leveled with a series of steps or stairs reaching from one level to another""?
GE:  NO  Approved, if it is made clear what that means. The definition is not clear enough. Question to IT : Is the Rialto bridge in Venice an example for that ?

UK: YES
GE: YES  But why not one feature „cable“ differentiated with LOC ?
CZ:  Would it be sufficient having only one feature ""Cable"" and the position (underground, overhead, ...) an attribute? Instead of adding a reference mark AT006 as obsolete.
US:  (Buckley):  This change is only to add a reference to AT006, not to change this feature.  The addition of AT006 was approved in June 1997 and is required to add an overhead cable.  There was no interest expressed at the time in materially modifying this feature to remove the Underwater/Underground connotation.  We need both features to adquately map to S-57.
IT:   NO  Maybe, IT was the only nation that did not concur with the addition of the AT006 and that suggested the use of LOC035. Now we are still discussing on the opportunity to use a feature or an attribute to map a geographic entity!
IT opinion is to limit as much as possible the introduction of new redundancies, even if possible now,  to avoid confusion and unnecessary duplications."

US:  NO, unless amended.  I have a question about the name ""Spout"".  I suspect that the name in English should be something else, especially when reading the IT comment.  Are we talking about the water processing and distribution infrastructure which will process the water delivered by the aqueduct.  When I read the word ""Spout"" I immediately think of a spigot or small pipe. Going by the IT comment, I would suggest the US-English term ""Water Works"" with a new definition of ""The processing and distribution infrastructure associated with an aqueduct, excluding the pipes and pipelines used for distribution to the ultimate consumer"".

GE:  NO  1) Has concerns about the use of scale or product dependent words such as 'isolated'.
         2) Depends on the scale as well. And : Conflict with DB160 Rock Strata /Rock Formation.
BE:  An isolated rock and an isolated rocky formation are not necessarily the same thing.
UK:  This conflict will be common when we are mapping to a catalog having a 'higher authority' such as IHO.
ALL: Keep as generic as possible to allow maximum scope for use.
US:  In using the IHO definition, we are being less restrictive however I have changed the feature name to reflect the full scope of the attribute.
UK:  Still thinking!!  FWP6 had a problem with this. Concerned about mixed concepts, confusion with DB160, and meaning of “isolated”   ??????????
CZ:  ""Isolated"" seems to be clear, I understand it as an opposite to connected here. I don't see any scale dependency in it.  FACC deals with real world features, not with maps.
US:  YES
The fundamental purpose of this new feature is to support a mariner looking for conspicuous landmarks to use in fixing his position.  A rock or boulder in a talus slope amongst many others is not conspicuous, one standing alone on a hillside is.  The same goes for a rock outcrop.  In many parts of the world, especially with a paucity of conspicuous landmarks, rocks and outcrops are frequently charted to be used by the mariner as landmarks.  The scale of reference is the mariner's view.  If it can be portrayed as a single object and if the mariner can quickly recognize it with no doubt of it being confused with others, then it belongs here.
IT:  NO  Seems to be in conflict with DB160.  However, needs further discussion!"
